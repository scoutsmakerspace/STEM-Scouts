title: Soldering badges
summary: >-
  A hands-on electronics activity where young people learn the basics of
  soldering by building a real, working electronic badge. Participants are
  introduced to printed circuit boards (PCBs), electronic components such as
  LEDs, resistors, switches, and batteries, and the correct techniques for
  making safe and reliable solder joints.


  The activity is delivered using pre-designed badge kits with clear, step-by-step instructions and is suitable for both first-time soldering experiences and more advanced builds, depending on the chosen badge. Emphasis is placed on tool safety, close supervision, and understanding how simple electrical circuits work, with each young person taking home a completed badge at the end of the session.
