- Animals live all around us, from tiny insects to big, strong deer. Find out about

  live far away.
- Lots of animals use plants for food and shelter, including hungry caterpillars that
  munch on leaves and birds that nest in trees. Find out about what animals in your
  local area like to eat and where they like to live.

  have damaged the places that they live. Work together to make something that helps
  plants or animals.
