completion_rules: Complete ALL 3 mandatory + 4 of 7 optional
requirements_count: 10
requirements:
- Trim a paper aeroplane or model glider to glide, stall and turn, then find out how
  an aircraft’s trimming, weight and balance can affect its flight.
- Draw a runway and the circuit pattern that planes follow, then explain how air traffic
  control uses this circuit to keep planes safe and communicate with pilots.
- Learn how the wind’s speed and direction are measured, then find out why they’re
  important during take-off and landing.
- Try an air-based activity and share what you learned.
- Find out about the roles and responsibilities of flight crew members, such as pilots,
  co-pilots, engineers or cabin crew.
- Simulate a take-off and landing using a flight simulator.
- Explain why pilot's (and other flight crew) use a pre-flight checklist.
- Explore the different types of emergency radio calls used in aviation, such as mayday
  and pan-pan
- Follow the flight path of an aircraft using maps and satellite images and see how
  landmarks help pilots find their way.
- Learn why Morse code is still used by navigational beacons and recognise six three-letter
  sequences.
