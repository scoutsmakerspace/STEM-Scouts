    strength: strong

    - Engineering & design
    why_stem: Engineering is about designing, building and improving solutions under
      constraints; this requirement builds iterative problem-solving and evaluation.

    - 'Ask: What was your constraint? What did you change to improve it? What would
      you try next?'

    strength: strong
    areas:
    - Maths & data
    - Engineering & design
    why_stem: Uses measurement and quantitative reasoning (units, rates, comparisons
      or data handling), which are foundational STEM skills. Navigation combines measurement,
      geometry and interpreting instruments/maps—practical STEM skills used in aviation,
      maritime and outdoor systems.
    leader_prompts:
    - Ask them to estimate first, then calculate/measure, and compare the two.
    - Ask them to explain how they know they're heading the right way (what evidence
      are they using?).

    why_stem: Radio and space activities introduce signals, communication protocols

      careers. Uses measurement and quantitative reasoning (units, rates, comparisons
      or data handling), which are foundational STEM skills.
    leader_prompts:
    - Ask what can cause a message to be misunderstood and how protocols reduce errors.
    - 'For older sections: discuss frequency, interference, and why antennas matter.'
    - Ask them to estimate first, then calculate/measure, and compare the two.

    strength: strong
    areas:
    - Digital systems
    - Engineering & design
    why_stem: Simulation is a core STEM tool used to model complex systems safely;
      using a simulator encourages systems thinking and interpreting feedback from
      instruments or outcomes. Engineering is about designing, building and improving
      solutions under constraints; this requirement builds iterative problem-solving
      and evaluation.
    leader_prompts:
    - Ask them to change one variable and describe the cause-and-effect they observed.
    - 'Ask: What was your constraint? What did you change to improve it? What would
      you try next?'
