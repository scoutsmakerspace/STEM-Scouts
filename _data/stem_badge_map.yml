        text: Anyone can be a superhero if they use their skills to make the world a
          better place. Design your superhero costume, choose your powers, and
          think about how you’ll use your powers to help other people.

        areas:
          - Engineering & design
        why_stem: Engineering is about designing, building and improving solutions under
          constraints; this requirement builds iterative problem-solving and
          evaluation.
        leader_prompts:
          - "Ask: What was your constraint? What did you change to improve it?
            What would you try next?"
