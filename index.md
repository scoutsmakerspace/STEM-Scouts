## Welcome to STEM Scouts

This site brings together **practical STEM activities, safety guidance, and leader notes** used across Scouts sections.

Everything here is designed to be:
- hands-on
- adaptable to different age groups
- realistic for volunteer leaders
- grounded in proper risk assessment and safeguarding practice

You’ll find activities covering electronics, coding, science, radio, making, and problem-solving — with clear “at a glance” summaries and linked risk assessments where appropriate.

## Who this is for

This site is primarily for:
- Scout leaders and assistants
- Explorer leaders
- Section volunteers running STEM-based activities
- Anyone supporting youth STEM within Scouting

Activities can be adapted for different sections and abilities. Always use your judgement and follow local guidance.

## Safety first

STEM activities often involve tools, equipment, and experimentation.

For each activity, you should:
1. Check the **At a glance** summary.
2. Read the linked **Risk Assessment**.
3. Apply the listed controls and supervision levels.
4. Adapt for your section, setting, and experience.

If an activity does not yet link to a risk assessment, it should **not be used** until one is created and reviewed.

## How to use this site

1. Browse or search for an activity.
2. Review the overview and requirements.
3. Open and follow the linked Risk Assessment.
4. Use uploaded documents or external tutorials as needed.
5. Treat badge links as references — official requirements may change.

This is a living resource and will grow over time.
